# terraform-IaC
This repository contains infrastructure as code (IaC) templates written in Terraform to automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of cloud resources across various providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).

# Terraform Infrastructure Repository

This repository contains Terraform scripts for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure across various cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.). The Terraform configurations are designed to provide a modular, reusable, and scalable way to define and manage cloud resources using infrastructure as code (IaC).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (v0.12 or later)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) or other cloud provider CLI (e.g., Azure CLI, GCP SDK)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/godfrey-tankan/terraform-IaC.git
    cd terraform-IaC
    ```

2. Initialize Terraform in the desired environment:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

3. Plan your changes to review what will be created:

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

4. Apply the changes to provision the infrastructure:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

### Repository Structure

- **/modules**: Reusable Terraform modules for various cloud services (e.g., compute, networking, databases)
- **/environments**: Separate directories for staging, production, and other environments
- **/examples**: Example configurations that show how to use the modules
- **/main.tf**: Entry point Terraform configuration to define cloud resources
- **/variables.tf**: Defines input variables that customize your infrastructure
- **/outputs.tf**: Outputs that provide important values after deployment (e.g., public IP, database endpoint)

### Terraform Commands

- `terraform init`: Initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
- `terraform plan`: Generate and show an execution plan.
- `terraform apply`: Execute the actions proposed in a Terraform plan.
- `terraform destroy`: Destroy all infrastructure managed by the Terraform files.

### Environment Variables

Depending on your cloud provider, you may need to set specific environment variables to authenticate and configure Terraform. For example, with AWS:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
